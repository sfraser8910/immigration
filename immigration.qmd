Immigration is a highly contentious topic in American politics and is a key issue for many polititians. Using data from Enos which examines Boston commuters, some of whom were exposed to Spanish speakers on a train platform, we will attempt to answer the question "What is the average causal effect of exposure to Spanish-speakers on attitudes toward immigration?" One potential weakness in this approach is that the assumption of representativeness may not hold.
